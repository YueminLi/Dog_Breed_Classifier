# Dog_Breed_Classifier
Identify dog breed using convolutional neural network(CNN)

Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Project Motivation

This project builds up three CNNs and an algorithm to identify the breed of dogs in images and differentiate dogs with humans as well as other objects/species.
